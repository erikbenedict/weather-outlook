# Weather Outlook

## Description

If you are a traveler, or just like to be prepared for what mother nature might throw your way, then this weather application is great for you! You can use this app to search for any major city's weather. It will display the current weather, along with a 5-day forecast. This will include the dates, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. 

Below are instructions on how to get started!

## Instructions

1. Click on the link in the 'Deployed Application' section to start.
1. Once you launch the application, type in a valid city name in the search bar, then press 'Enter' or click on Search.
2. Once this is completed, you will be presented with the current weather for that city, along with a 5-day forecast.
3. You will also notice that once you search a city, it will appear below the search field and save that city for future use!
4. If you want to see a previously searched city's weather information, click on the button with the name of the city you want to see.
5. If you wish to clear your search history, just use the 'Clear Search History' button at the bottom of the saved searches. This will delete all previously searched cities, and give you a clean slate to work with.
